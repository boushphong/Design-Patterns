# Template Method

The Template Method design pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain steps of the algorithm. The pattern follows the "Hollywood Principle": "Don't call us, we'll call you." In other words, the base class (the template) controls the overall algorithm flow and delegates specific steps to the subclasses.
