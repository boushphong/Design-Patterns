# Chain Of Responsibility
The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled or reaches the end of the chain. Each handler in the chain has the ability to handle the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.
