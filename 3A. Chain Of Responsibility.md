# Chain of Responsibility
The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled or reaches the end of the chain. Each handler in the chain has the ability to handle the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void accelerate();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Car is accelerating.");
    }
}

interface VehicleInspectionStation {
    void inspect(Vehicle vehicle);
    void setNextStation(VehicleInspectionStation safetyStation);
}

class EngineInspectionStation implements VehicleInspectionStation {
    private VehicleInspectionStation nextStation;

    public void setNextStation(VehicleInspectionStation nextStation) {
        this.nextStation = nextStation;
    }

    public void inspect(Vehicle vehicle) {
        // Perform engine inspection (Can contain specific logic)
        System.out.println("Inspecting engine of the vehicle");

        // Pass the request to the next station
        if (nextStation != null) {
            nextStation.inspect(vehicle);
        }
    }
}

class SafetyInspectionStation implements VehicleInspectionStation {
    private VehicleInspectionStation nextStation;

    public void setNextStation(VehicleInspectionStation nextStation) {
        this.nextStation = nextStation;
    }

    public void inspect(Vehicle vehicle) {
        // Perform safety inspection (Can contain specific logic)
        System.out.println("Performing safety inspection of the vehicle");

        // Pass the request to the next station
        if (nextStation != null) {
            nextStation.inspect(vehicle);
        }
    }
}

class EmissionInspectionStation implements VehicleInspectionStation {
    private VehicleInspectionStation nextStation;

    public void setNextStation(VehicleInspectionStation nextStation) {
        this.nextStation = nextStation;
    }

    public void inspect(Vehicle vehicle) {
        // Perform emission inspection (Can contain specific logic)
        System.out.println("Conducting emission inspection of the vehicle");

        // Pass the request to the next station
        if (nextStation != null) {
            nextStation.inspect(vehicle);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create the inspection stations
        VehicleInspectionStation engineStation = new EngineInspectionStation();
        VehicleInspectionStation emissionStation = new EmissionInspectionStation();
        VehicleInspectionStation safetyStation = new SafetyInspectionStation();

        // Set up the chain of responsibility
        engineStation.setNextStation(emissionStation);
        emissionStation.setNextStation(safetyStation);

        // Create a vehicle
        Vehicle vehicle = new Car();

        // Start the inspection process
        engineStation.inspect(vehicle);
    }
}
```

In this example, the Chain of Responsibility pattern is implemented through the `VehicleInspectionStation` handler interface and its concrete handlers are: `EngineInspectionStation`, `SafetyInspectionStation`, and `EmissionInspectionStation`.

The `VehicleInspectionStation` interface defines the common contract for all inspection stations. It includes a method `inspect(Vehicle vehicle)` that represents the entry point for the inspection process. Each inspection station in the chain implements this interface. Each inspection station has a reference to the next station in the chain, which is set using the `setNextStation()` method. This establishes the order in which the inspections are performed.

When an inspection station receives a request to inspect a vehicle, it performs its specific inspection logic and then decide whether to pass the request to the next station in the chain by calling `nextStation.inspect(vehicle)` or not. This way, the request is delegated down the chain until all the inspections have been performed or stopped midway along the chain.

In the `Main` class, the inspection stations are created (`engineStation`, `emissionStation`, `safetyStation`), and the chain of responsibility is established by setting the next station for each station in the desired order. Finally, the inspection process is initiated by calling `engineStation.inspect(vehicle)` with a `Vehicle` object (`Car` in this case). This request propagates through the chain, and each inspection station performs its specific inspection before passing the request to the next station.

This way, the Chain of Responsibility pattern allows each inspection station to handle a request independently and decide whether to pass it to the next station or terminate the chain. It provides a flexible and decoupled approach to handle requests by dynamically configuring the chain and avoiding explicit dependencies between the sender and receiver of a request.

# Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern Summary
**Use the CoR pattern when your program is expected to process different kinds of requests in various ways, but the exact types of requests and their sequences are unknown beforehand.**

- By linking several handlers into one chain and, upon receiving a request, “ask” each handler whether it can process it. This means each handler has the ability to handle a specific type of request. When a request is received, it is passed through the chain of handlers until a handler capable of processing that type of request is found. This way, the system can dynamically determine which handler should process a given request based on its type, without prior knowledge of the request types or their order.

**Use the pattern when it’s essential to execute several handlers in a particular order.**

**Use the CoR pattern when the set of handlers and their order are supposed to change at runtime.**
- If you provide setters for a reference field inside the handler classes, you’ll be able to insert, remove or reorder handlers dynamically.
