# Factory Method
The Factory Method Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. This pattern promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need for classes to have knowledge of the specific objects they need to create.

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void createVehicle();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void createVehicle() {
        System.out.println("Creating a car");
    }
}

class Motorcycle implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void createVehicle() {
        System.out.println("Creating a motorcycle");
    }
}

class VehicleFactory {
    public Vehicle createVehicle(String vehicleType) {
        if (vehicleType.equalsIgnoreCase("car")) {
            return new Car();
        } else if (vehicleType.equalsIgnoreCase("motorcycle")) {
            return new Motorcycle();
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid vehicle type");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VehicleFactory factory = new VehicleFactory();
        Vehicle vehicle = factory.createVehicle("car");
        vehicle.createVehicle();
    }
}
```

We have an interface `Vehicle` with a method `createVehicle()`. We also have two classes that implement this interface, `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and override the `createVehicle()` method.

We then have a `VehicleFactory` class that takes a `vehicleType` argument and returns the appropriate vehicle object based on the type specified.

Finally, in the `main` method, we create a `VehicleFactory` object and use it to create a `Car` object, which then calls the `createVehicle()` method on itself.

## Factory Method Design Pattern Summary:
- Create objects without having to know the specific class that needs to be instantiated. 
  - Reduce the construction of components into a single Factory Method `VehicleFactory`
- To add a new `Object`, you'll only need to a new `Subclass` that implements the `Vehicle` interface and add extra logic into the factory method.
