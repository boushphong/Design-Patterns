# Flyweight
The Flyweight design pattern is a structural pattern that aims to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible between multiple similar objects. It is useful when you have a large number of objects that share common properties and can be effectively shared.

In Flyweight pattern, a HashMap is used to store reference to the object which have already been created, every object is associated with a key. Now when a client wants to create an object, it simply has to pass a key associated with it and if the object has already been created we simply get the reference to that object else it creates a new object and then returns it reference to the client.

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void drive();
}

// Intrinsic State: Shared by multiple flyweight objects
class StolenCar implements Vehicle {
    private final String brand;
    private final String model;

    public StolenCar(String brand, String model) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
    }

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Stolen car: " + brand + " " + model + " is on the move");
    }
}

// Extrinsic State: Unique for each flyweight object
class PoliceCar implements Vehicle {
    private final String department;
    private String currentLocation;

    public PoliceCar(String department, String currentLocation) {
        this.department = department;
        this.currentLocation = currentLocation;
    }

    public void setCurrentLocation(String location) {
        this.currentLocation = location;
    }

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Police car of Department " + department + " at " + currentLocation + " is on a patrol");
    }
}

class VehicleFactory {
    private Map<String, StolenCar> stolenCars;

    public VehicleFactory() {
        this.stolenCars = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public StolenCar getStolenCar(String brand, String model) {
        String key = brand + "_" + model;

        if (stolenCars.containsKey(key)) {
            return stolenCars.get(key);
        } else {
            StolenCar stolenCar = new StolenCar(brand, model);
            stolenCars.put(key, stolenCar);
            return stolenCar;
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VehicleFactory vehicleFactory = new VehicleFactory();

        StolenCar stolenCar1 = vehicleFactory.getStolenCar("Toyota", "Corolla");
        stolenCar1.drive();  // Stolen car: Toyota Corolla is on the move

        PoliceCar policeCar1 = new PoliceCar("A", "City A");
        policeCar1.setCurrentLocation("City B");
        policeCar1.drive();  // Police car of Department A at City B is on a patrol

        StolenCar stolenCar2 = vehicleFactory.getStolenCar("Toyota", "Corolla");
        StolenCar stolenCar3 = vehicleFactory.getStolenCar("Toyota", "Camry");
        stolenCar2.drive();  // Stolen car: Toyota Corolla is on the move
        System.out.println(stolenCar1 == stolenCar2);  // true
        System.out.println(stolenCar1 == stolenCar2);  // false

        PoliceCar policeCar2 = new PoliceCar("B", "City A");
        PoliceCar policeCar3 = new PoliceCar("B", "City A");
        policeCar2.drive();  // Police car of Department B at City A is on a patrol

        System.out.println(policeCar2 == policeCar3); // false
    }
}
```

In this example (Simulating a game), flyweight pattern is used to optimize memory usage by sharing common data between multiple objects `StolenCar`. The intrinsic state (`brand`, `model` of `StolenCar` objects), which is shared among flyweight objects. The intrinsic state is immutable and can be shared among different contexts. On the other hand, the extrinsic state is unique for each object (`department`, `currentLocation` of `PoliceCar` objects). `StolenCar` and `PoliceCar` both share a Flyweight interface `Vehicle`, however they differ in:
- `StolenCar` with the same `brand` and `model` would share the same object (`stolenCar1`, `stolenCar2`) (Intrinsic State: They are shared among multiple clients to save memory footprint (**ConcreteFlyweight**))
- `PoliceCar` with the same `department` and `currentLocation` don't share the same object (`policeCar2`, `policeCar3` are different objects) (Extrinsic State: They are unique to each client and contain information that can vary from one context to another (**UnsharedConcreteFlyweight**))

The `VehicleFactory` class acts as a flyweight factory. It maintains a map of stolen cars to ensure that only one instance of a stolen car is created for each brand and model. This allows efficient sharing of stolen car instances.

In the `Main` class, the flyweight pattern is demonstrated by creating `StolenCar` objects through the `VehicleFactory`. Multiple references to the same stolen car are obtained (`stolenCar1`, `stolenCar2`) from the factory. The police cars, on the other hand, have different extrinsic states as they belong to different departments and have different locations, and they are unique from one another (`policeCar2`, `policeCar3` are different objects but share the same attributes)

The flyweight pattern in this example allows efficient sharing of common intrinsic state (stolen car details) while maintaining unique extrinsic state (police car details) for each object. This helps in reducing memory consumption and improves performance in scenarios where many similar objects with shared state are used.

# Flyweight Design Pattern Summary
**Use the Flyweight pattern only when your program must support a huge number of objects which barely fit into available RAM.**

- The benefit of applying the pattern depends heavily on how and where it’s used. It’s most useful when:
  - An application needs to spawn a huge number of similar objects. (eg. All the `StolenCar` objects in an online game like **GTA**)
  - This drains all available RAM on a target device.
  - The objects contain duplicate states which can be extracted and shared between multiple objects. (eg. the same `StolenCar` objects for instance multiple stolen Ford Mustangs in GTA would have the same speed, 4 wheels ...)
