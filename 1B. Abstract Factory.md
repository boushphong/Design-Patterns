# Abstract Factory
Extending from [Factory Method Example](https://github.com/boushphong/Design-Patterns/blob/master/1a.%20Factory%20Method.md). If there are too many vehicle types and the `createVehicle` method becomes too big, it can become difficult to manage and maintain the code. To address this issue, we can use the Abstract Factory Design Pattern.

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This means that we can group related classes together and create factories for each group, which makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.

```java
// Abstract Product
interface Vehicle {
    void drive();
}

// Concrete Product
class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a car");
    }
}

// Concrete Product
class Motorcycle implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a motorcycle");
    }
}

// Abstract Factory
interface VehicleFactory {
    Vehicle createCar();
    Vehicle createMotorcycle();
}

// Concrete Factory
class BMWFactory implements VehicleFactory {
    @Override
    public Vehicle createCar() {
        return new Car();
    }

    @Override
    public Vehicle createMotorcycle() {
        return new Motorcycle();
    }
}


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VehicleFactory factory = new BMWFactory();
        Vehicle car = factory.createCar();
        car.drive();

        Vehicle motorcycle = factory.createMotorcycle();
        motorcycle.drive();
    }
}
```

In this example, we have an interface `Vehicle` with an abstract method `drive()`. We also have two classes that implement this interface, `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and override the `drive()` method.

We then have an interface `VehicleFactory` with an abstract method `createVehicle()`. We also have a `BMWFactory` class that implement this interface, overriding the `createVehicle()` method to create the appropriate type of vehicle.

Finally, in the `main` method, we create a BMW factory, which the responsibility of this class is to create both cars and motorcycles.

## Abstract Factory Design Pattern Summary:
**Work with families of related products, but you don’t want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products—they might be unknown beforehand or you simply want to allow for future extensibility.**
- Provide an interface for creating objects from each class of the product family so you don't have to worry about creating an incorrect variant of an `Object` that doesn't match existing `Object` in the App.

**Consider implementing the `Abstract Factory` when you have a class with a set of `Factory Methods` that blur its primary responsibility.**
- When a class deals with multiple `Object` types, it's recommended to extract its factory method into a standalone `Factory` class or a full-blown Abstract Factory implementation.
