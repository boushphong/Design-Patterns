# Prototype
The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying existing objects, known as prototypes, without the need for explicitly invoking constructors. The prototype serves as a blueprint for creating new objects, and the pattern is useful when creating objects is complex or costly.

In the context of the `Vehicle` and `Car` example, the Prototype Design Pattern would involve creating a prototype object (e.g., an existing `Car` instance) and then creating new `Car` objects by copying the prototype. This approach avoids the need for repeatedly constructing new objects from scratch, which can be expensive or involve complex initialization logic.

```java
import java.util.Objects;

interface Vehicle extends Cloneable {
    String getBrand();

    String getModel();

    int getYear();

    void setBrand(String brand);

    void setModel(String model);

    void setYear(int year);
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    private String brand;
    private String model;
    private int year;

    public Car(String brand, String model, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    @Override
    public Car clone() {
        try {
            return (Car) super.clone();
        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
            // Handle the exception, if necessary
            return null;
        }
    }

    // Getters and setters omitted for brevity
    // ...
}

class Truck implements Vehicle {
    private String brand;
    private String model;
    private int year;

    public Truck(String brand, String model, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    @Override
    public Truck clone() {
        try {
            return (Truck) super.clone();
        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
            // Handle the exception, if necessary
            return null;
        }
    }

    // Getters and setters omitted for brevity
    // ...
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle carPrototype = new Car("Basic Car", "Unknown", 0);
        
        // Will give out different objects (shallow-copy of carPrototype)
        Car car1 = ((Car) carPrototype).clone(); 
        Car car2 = ((Car) carPrototype).clone();
        car1.print();  // Car is driving
        
        car2.setBrand("Toyota");
        car2.setModel("Camry");
        car2.setYear(2012);

        Vehicle truckPrototype = new Truck("Truck", "Cybertruck", 2023);
        Truck truck1 = ((Truck) truckPrototype).clone();
        truck1.print(); // Truck is driving
        
        
        System.out.println(car1);  // Car@355da254
        System.out.println(car2);  // Car@4dc63996
    }
}
```
In this example, we have an interface called `Vehicle` that acts as a Prototype and extends the `Cloneable` interface. The `Vehicle` interface defines methods for retrieving and modifying the brand, model, and year of a vehicle.

We have two concrete classes, `Car` and `Truck`, which both implement the `Vehicle` interface. These classes provide their own implementations of the `clone` method by invoking `super.clone()` and performing the necessary cast.

In the `Main` class, we demonstrate the Prototype pattern by creating prototype objects (`carPrototype` and `truckPrototype`) representing a car and a truck, respectively. We then clone these prototypes to create new instances of `Car` and `Truck`. By using the `clone` method, we create independent copies of the prototype objects. The `clone` method performs a shallow copy, meaning the copied objects share references to the same brand, model, and year values. However, the objects themselves are different instances.

## Prototype Design Pattern Summary
- Use the **Prototype pattern** when your code shouldn’t depend on the **concrete classes** of objects that you need to copy.
    - This happens a lot when your code works with objects passed to you from 3rd-party code via some **interface** without having direct knowledge of the concrete classes' implementations. The **concrete classes** of these objects are unknown, and you couldn’t depend on them even if you wanted to.
        - The clones are independent copies (`car1`, `car2`) that can be modified without affecting the original prototypes.
    - The **Prototype pattern** provides the client code with a general **interface** for working with all objects that support cloning. This interface makes the client code independent from the **concrete classes** of objects that it clones.
- Use the pattern when you want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their respective objects. Somebody could have created these subclasses to be able to create objects with a specific configuration.
    - The Prototype pattern lets you use a set of pre-built objects, configured in various ways, as prototypes.
    - Instead of instantiating a subclass that matches some configuration, the client can simply look for an appropriate prototype and clone it.
        - `Car` and `Truck`, both implementing the `Vehicle` interface. These classes represent different types of vehicles. Instead of creating separate subclasses for each type of vehicle with different configurations, the Prototype pattern is employed.
        - By using the clone method, we can create new instances of `Car` and `Truck` that are clones of a prototype object. This eliminates the need for separate subclasses to handle different configurations. Instead, we can create a single instance of each type of vehicle and clone it whenever we need a new object with the same initial configuration. (eg. We modified `car2` properties (configuration) in the `Main` class)


## Note
The `clone` method of the `Object` class in Java performs a shallow copy of the object by creating a new instance of the same class and copying the field values from the original object to the new object. It does not invoke the constructor of the class being cloned.

`java/lang/Object.class` is implemented as:
```java
protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException;
```

The `clone` method is declared as `protected` in the `Object` class and is native, which means its implementation is provided by the underlying JVM.

When you implement the `Cloneable` interface in your own class and override the `clone` method, the default implementation in the `Object` class provides the basic functionality of creating a new instance and copying the field values.

However, it's important to note that the default implementation of `clone` in the `Object` class performs a shallow copy. This means that if the object being cloned contains references to other objects, those references are copied to the new object. As a result, both the original and cloned objects will reference the same objects, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the referenced objects are mutable.

If you require a deep copy, where all referenced objects are also cloned, you need to override the `clone` method in your class and manually perform the deep copy logic.

It's worth mentioning that the `clone` method has some limitations and considerations, and it's generally recommended to use other mechanisms, such as copy constructors or the `clone` method from the `Cloneable` interface, to achieve object cloning in a more controlled and consistent manner.
