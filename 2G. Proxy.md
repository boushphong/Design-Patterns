# Proxy
The proxy design pattern provides a substitute or placeholder for another object to control its access. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

interface Vehicle {
    void drive(String location);
}

class RealAIPoweredVehicle implements Vehicle {

    @Override
    public void drive(String location) {
        System.out.println("RealAIPoweredVehicle is being driven. Arrival destination: " + location);
    }
}

class AIPoweredVehicleProxy implements Vehicle {
    private RealAIPoweredVehicle realAIPoweredVehicle;
    private static List<String> carFreeLocation;

    static {
        carFreeLocation = new ArrayList<>();
        carFreeLocation.add("Pedestrian Zone A");
        carFreeLocation.add("Pedestrian Zone B");
        carFreeLocation.add("Pedestrian Zone C");
    }

    public AIPoweredVehicleProxy() {
        this.realAIPoweredVehicle = new RealAIPoweredVehicle();
    }

    @Override
    public void drive(String location) {
        // Additional functionality or control can be added here
        System.out.println("Proxy: Checking if arrival destination is prohibited");
        if (carFreeLocation.contains(location)) {
            System.out.println(location + " doesn't allow arrival by the mean of a vehicle");
            System.out.println("Please select another location!");
        } else {
            // Forward the request
            realAIPoweredVehicle.drive(location);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AIPoweredVehicleProxy vehicleProxy = new AIPoweredVehicleProxy();
        vehicleProxy.drive("Zone A");
        // Proxy: Checking if arrival destination is prohibited
        // RealAIPoweredVehicle is being driven. Arrival destination: Zone A

        vehicleProxy.drive("Pedestrian Zone C");
        // Proxy: Checking if arrival destination is prohibited
        // Pedestrian Zone C doesn't allow arrival by the mean of a vehicle
        // Please select another location!
    }
}
```

In this example, the Proxy design pattern is demonstrated using the concept of an AI-Powered vehicle.  The `Vehicle` interface defines the common methods that all vehicles should implement. The `RealAIPoweredVehicle` class is the actual implementation of the `Vehicle` interface. It represents a real AI-powered vehicle that can be driven to a specific location.

The `AIPoweredVehicleProxy` class serves as a **proxy** for the `RealAIPoweredVehicle` object. It also implements the `Vehicle` interface and contains an instance of the `RealAIPoweredVehicle` class. It also has a static list `carFreeLocation` that represents locations where vehicles are not allowed to arrive. This list is used for additional control.

When the `drive(String location)` method is called on the `AIPoweredVehicleProxy` object, it performs some additional functionality before forwarding the request to the real object.

In the `Main` class (can be though of as the `Client`), we create an instance of the `AIPoweredVehicleProxy` and call its `drive(String location)` method. The proxy intercepts the method call, checks if the location is prohibited, and either displays a message or delegates the actual driving to the real AI-powered vehicle.

The Proxy pattern is applied in this example to add additional functionality and control before delegating the request to the real object. The proxy class acts as a surrogate for the real AI-powered vehicle and provides a way to perform checks on the destination location before driving. It allows us to control the behavior of the real object without modifying its implementation, providing an extra layer of indirection and encapsulation.

# Proxy Design Pattern Summary

**Use the Proxy Pattern to utilize Lazy Initialization (Virtual Proxy). This is when you have a heavyweight service object that wastes system resources by being always up, even though you only need it from time to time.**
  - Instead of creating the object when the app launches, you can delay the object’s initialization to a time when it’s really needed. This would save memory footprint.
  - Access control (protection proxy). This is when you want only specific clients to be able to use the service object; for instance, when your objects are crucial parts of an operating system and clients are various launched applications (including malicious ones). The proxy can pass the request to the service object only if the client’s credentials match some criteria.
