# Facade
The Facade Design Pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, making it easier to use and understand. It acts as a unified interface that encapsulates the functionality of a set of subsystems, providing a higher-level interface that makes it easier for clients to interact with the system.

```java
// Subsystem classes
class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Engine stopped");
    }
}

class FuelInjector {
    public void on() {
        System.out.println("Fuel injector turned on");
    }

    public void off() {
        System.out.println("Fuel injector turned off");
    }
}

class IgnitionSystem {
    public void ignite() {
        System.out.println("Ignition system ignited");
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("Ignition system turned off");
    }
}

// Facade class
class CarFacade {
    private Engine engine;
    private FuelInjector fuelInjector;
    private IgnitionSystem ignitionSystem;

    public CarFacade() {
        this.engine = new Engine();
        this.fuelInjector = new FuelInjector();
        this.ignitionSystem = new IgnitionSystem();
    }

    public void startCar() {
        System.out.println("Starting the car...");
        engine.start();
        fuelInjector.on();
        ignitionSystem.ignite();
        System.out.println("Car started successfully");
    }

    public void stopCar() {
        System.out.println("Stopping the car...");
        engine.stop();
        fuelInjector.off();
        ignitionSystem.turnOff();
        System.out.println("Car stopped");
    }
}

// Client code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CarFacade carFacade = new CarFacade();

        // Start the car using the facade
        carFacade.startCar();

        // Stop the car using the facade
        carFacade.stopCar();
    }
}
```



In this example, we have a complex system composed of multiple subsystems: `Engine`, `FuelInjector`, and `IgnitionSystem`. Each subsystem has its own set of methods and functionality.

The `CarFacade` class acts as a facade that provides a simplified interface to the client. It encapsulates the functionality of the subsystems and exposes higher-level methods that allow the client to start and stop the car without needing to interact directly with the subsystems.

The `CarFacade` class internally creates instances of the subsystem classes (`Engine`, `FuelInjector`, and `IgnitionSystem`). The `startCar` and `stopCar` methods of the facade orchestrate the interactions with the subsystems in the appropriate order to start and stop the car.

In the `Main` class, we create an instance of the `CarFacade`. We can then use the facade's `startCar` and `stopCar` methods to start and stop the car, respectively. The client doesn't need to know the internal details or complexities of the subsystems; it simply uses the facade to interact with the car system.

The Facade Design Pattern simplifies the usage of complex systems by providing a high-level interface that encapsulates the interactions with the underlying subsystems. It promotes loose coupling and enhances code maintainability by reducing dependencies on the subsystems and providing a clear and concise interface for clients to work with.
