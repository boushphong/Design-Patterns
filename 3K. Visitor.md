# Visitor
The Visitor design pattern is used to separate the algorithm or operations from the objects on which it operates. It allows adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. In this pattern, the operations are encapsulated in visitor objects, which can visit different types of objects and perform specific operations on them.
