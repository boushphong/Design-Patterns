# Memento
The Memento pattern allows an object (the originator) to capture its internal state and save it externally in a memento object. This memento object can later be used to restore the state of the originator.

```java
// Originator
class ToyVehicle {
    private boolean isStolen;
    private String nickname;

    public ToyVehicle(String nickname, boolean isStolen) {
        this.nickname = nickname;
        this.isStolen = isStolen;
    }

    public String getNickname() {
        return nickname;
    }

    public void setNickname(String nickname) {
        this.nickname = nickname;
    }

    public boolean isStolen() {
        return isStolen;
    }

    public void setStolen(boolean isStolen) {
        this.isStolen = isStolen;
    }

    public VehicleMemento save() {
        return new VehicleMemento(nickname, isStolen);
    }

    public void restore(VehicleMemento memento) {
        this.isStolen = memento.isStolen();
        this.nickname = memento.getNickname();
    }
}

// Memento
class VehicleMemento {
    private final boolean isStolen;
    private final String nickname;

    public VehicleMemento(String nickname, boolean isStolen) {
        this.nickname = nickname;
        this.isStolen = isStolen;
    }

    public boolean isStolen() {
        return isStolen;
    }

    public String getNickname() {
        return nickname;
    }
}

// Caretaker
class VehicleHistory {
    private List<VehicleMemento> history = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addMemento(VehicleMemento memento) {
        history.add(memento);
    }

    public VehicleMemento getMemento(int index) {
        return history.get(index);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a vehicle
        ToyVehicle vehicle = new ToyVehicle("Red Car", false);
        System.out.println("Initial State: Stolen - " + vehicle.isStolen() + ", Nickname - " + vehicle.getNickname());

        // Create a history to store mementos
        VehicleHistory history = new VehicleHistory();

        // Save the initial state
        history.addMemento(vehicle.save());

        // Modify the vehicle
        vehicle.setStolen(true);
        vehicle.setNickname("Red Car with Stickers");
        System.out.println("Modified State: Stolen - " + vehicle.isStolen() + ", Nickname - " + vehicle.getNickname());

        // Save the modified state
        history.addMemento(vehicle.save());

        // Restore the initial state
        vehicle.restore(history.getMemento(0));
        System.out.println("Restored State: Stolen - " + vehicle.isStolen() + ", Nickname - " + vehicle.getNickname());
    }
}
```

In this example, the Originator `ToyVehicle` represents the object whose state needs to be saved and restored. It has fields to represent the state, such as `isStolen` (stolen status) and `nickname`. The `save()` method creates a memento object (`VehicleMemento`) containing the current state of the originator. The `restore()` method restores the state of the originator using a memento object.

The Memento (`VehicleMemento`) represents the saved state of the originator. It has the exact fields with the Originator object to store the state of the originator, such as `isStolen` and `nickname`.

 Caretaker (`VehicleHistory`) is responsible for storing and managing the mementos of the originator. It maintains a list of mementos (`history`) and provides methods to add and retrieve mementos.

In the `Main` class, we demonstrate the usage of the Memento pattern:
- You create a `ToyVehicle` object with an initial state (not stolen and with a nickname).
- Then, you create a `VehicleHistory` object to store the mementos.
- The initial state of the `ToyVehicle` is saved using the `save()` method, and the memento is added to the `VehicleHistory`.
- You modify the `ToyVehicle` by setting it as stolen and updating the nickname.
- The modified state is saved again using the `save()` method, and the memento is added to the `VehicleHistory`.
- Finally, you restore the initial state by retrieving the memento from the `VehicleHistory` and using the `restore()` method.

The Memento pattern allows you to save and restore the state of the `ToyVehicle` object without exposing its internal structure. It provides a way to capture different states of the object and revert back to a specific state when needed.

# Memento Design Pattern Summary
**Use the Memento pattern when you want to produce snapshots of the object’s state to be able to restore a previous state of the object.**

- The Memento pattern lets you make full copies of an object’s state, including private fields, and store them separately from the object. While most people remember this pattern thanks to the “undo” use case, it’s also indispensable when dealing with transactions (i.e., if you need to roll back an operation on error).
  - In our example, the object's state is `VehicleMemento`, these kind of objects would be stored in the Caretaker `VehicleHistory` object. The Originator `Vehicle` could restore it's history state using it's `restore()` to interact with the Caretaker.

**Use the pattern when direct access to the object’s fields/getters/setters violates its encapsulation.**

- The Memento makes the object `ToyVehicle` itself responsible for creating a snapshot of its state. No other object can read the snapshot, making the original object’s state data safe and secure. The memento object `VehicleMemento` itself provides getters to access the state fields, but it is only accessible to the `ToyVehicle` class or other authorized classes responsible for restoring the state.
