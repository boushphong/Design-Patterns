# Command
The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. It decouples the sender of a request from its receiver, providing flexibility and extensibility in the system.

```java
// Receiver
interface Vehicle {
    void drive();
}

// Concrete Receivers
class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is being driven.");
    }
}

class Truck implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Truck is being driven.");
    }
}

// Command
interface Command {
    void execute();
}

// Concrete Commands
class DriveCommand implements Command {
    private Vehicle vehicle;

    public DriveCommand(Vehicle vehicle) {
        this.vehicle = vehicle;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        vehicle.drive();
    }
}

// Invoker
class Driver {
    private Command command;

    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void executeCommand() {
        command.execute();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = new Car();
        Command carDriveCommand = new DriveCommand(car);

        Vehicle truck = new Truck();
        Command truckDriveCommand = new DriveCommand(truck);

        Driver driver = new Driver();

        // Set and execute car drive command
        driver.setCommand(carDriveCommand);
        driver.executeCommand();
        // Output: Car is being driven.

        // Set and execute truck drive command
        driver.setCommand(truckDriveCommand);
        driver.executeCommand();
        // Output: Truck is being driven.
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Vehicle` interface represents the receiver of the command, which is responsible for performing the actual driving action. The concrete receiver classes, `Car` and `Truck`, implement the `Vehicle` interface and define their specific drive behaviors.

The `Command` interface represents the command itself, which declares the `execute()` method. The concrete command class, `DriveCommand`, encapsulates the receiver (i.e., the specific vehicle) and delegates the execution to the receiver's `drive()` method.

The `Driver` class acts as the invoker, which sets and executes the command. It is decoupled from the specific command and receiver, allowing for flexibility in assigning different commands to the driver.

Overall, the Command pattern helps in encapsulating and decoupling the sender of a request (the invoker) from the object that performs the actual action (the receiver), providing a more flexible and extensible design.

## Command Design Pattern Summary
**Use the Command pattern when you want to parametrize objects with operations**

- In the example, the `DriveCommand` class is a concrete command that encapsulates the `drive()` operation. It takes a `Vehicle` object (the receiver) as a parameter in its constructor. By doing so, we can parametrize the `DriveCommand` object with different receivers (i.e., different vehicles). This allows us to create different instances of `DriveCommand`, each associated with a specific `Vehicle` implementation. We can then pass these instances to the `Driver` object, which can execute the commands without knowing the specifics of the receivers.

  - For instance, we create a `Car` object and a corresponding `DriveCommand` object with the car as the receiver. Similarly, we create a `Truck` object and a corresponding `DriveCommand` object with the truck as the receiver. By parametrizing the `DriveCommand` objects with different receivers, we can pass them to the `Driver` object, which will execute the respective `drive()` operation on the receiver associated with each command.
  - This parametrization of objects with operations allows for greater flexibility and extensibility in the system. You can easily add new commands and associate them with different receivers without modifying the existing code.

**Use the Command pattern when you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.**

- We have a `Driver` class that acts as the invoker. Ideally, The `Driver` class could have a `commandQueue` (Implemented from the JAVA's `Iterable` interface), which is a queue of `Command` objects. The `Driver` class can enqueue commands to the `commandQueue` and execute them later.
  - This queuing of commands allows us to schedule their execution at a later time or in a specific order. For example, we can enqueue multiple `DriveCommand` objects representing different driving tasks. The `Driver` can then execute these commands sequentially, ensuring that the tasks are performed in the order they were enqueued.
  - Additionally, the Command pattern also enables the execution of commands remotely. In the example, we can imagine a scenario where the `Driver` and the `Vehicle` objects reside on different machines. The `Driver` can serialize the `Command` objects and send them over the network to the machine where the `Vehicle` objects exist. On that machine, the `Command` objects can be deserialized and executed on the respective `Vehicle` objects.
    - You would typically implement a client-server architecture for this operation. The `Driver` object would reside on the client machine, and the `Vehicle` object (or the server representing the Vehicle) would reside on the server machine.
    - The `Driver` object on the client machine can send commands (e.g., start, stop) to the server machine, where the `Vehicle` or a server-side representation of the `Vehicle` exists. The server machine would receive the commands, execute them on the appropriate `Vehicle` object, and send back the response or any relevant data to the client machine.

This ability to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely provides flexibility and control in managing the execution of commands. It allows for decoupling the invoker (`Driver`) from the actual execution of commands (`Vehicle` objects) and provides opportunities for optimization, synchronization, and distribution of tasks.

**Use the Command pattern when you want to implement reversible operations.**

Certainly! The Command pattern is well-suited for implementing reversible operations, where you need to support undo and redo functionality.

1. Define a new interface called `ReversibleCommand` that extends the existing `Command` interface. This interface should include two additional methods: `undo()` and `redo()`.
```java
interface ReversibleCommand extends Command {
    void undo();
    void redo();
}
```

2. Modify the `DriveCommand` and `StopCommand` classes to implement the `ReversibleCommand` interface and provide the necessary implementation for the `undo()` and `redo()` methods. The `undo()` method should reverse the effects of the command, and the `redo()` method should reapply the command.
```java
class DriveCommand implements ReversibleCommand {
    private Vehicle vehicle;
    private String location;

    public DriveCommand(Vehicle vehicle, String location) {
        this.vehicle = vehicle;
        this.location = location;
    }

    public void execute() {
        vehicle.drive(location);
    }

    public void undo() {
        // Reverse the effects of the drive command
        // For example, if the vehicle moved to the location, bring it back to the previous location.
    }

    public void redo() {
        // Reapply the drive command
        // This would be similar to executing the execute() method again
        execute();
    }
}

class StopCommand implements ReversibleCommand {
    private Vehicle vehicle;

    public StopCommand(Vehicle vehicle) {
        this.vehicle = vehicle;
    }

    public void execute() {
        vehicle.stop();
    }

    public void undo() {
        // Reverse the effects of the stop command
        // For example, resume the vehicle's previous state before it was stopped.
    }

    public void redo() {
        // Reapply the stop command
        // This would be similar to executing the execute() method again
        execute();
    }
}
```

3. With the modified `ReversibleCommand` interface and the updated command classes, you can now implement undo and redo functionality. You can maintain a history of executed commands and keep track of the current state. When the user triggers an undo command, you can retrieve the last executed command from the history and call its `undo()` method to reverse its effects. Similarly, for redo, you can call the `redo()` method of the command.

By introducing the `undo()` and `redo()` methods in the `ReversibleCommand` interface and implementing them in the command classes, you enable the ability to reverse and reapply commands, thus achieving reversible operations.

**Note:** 
- The implementation details of the `undo()` and `redo()` methods will depend on the specific requirements of your application and the nature of the commands being executed.
- To be able to revert operations after several executions, you need to implement the history of performed operations. The command history is a stack that contains all executed command objects along with related backups of the application’s state.
  - This method has two drawbacks. First, it isn’t that easy to save an application’s state because some of it can be private. This problem can be mitigated with the `Memento` pattern.
  - Second, the state backups may consume quite a lot of RAM. Therefore, sometimes you can resort to an alternative implementation: instead of restoring the past state, the command performs the inverse operation. The reverse operation also has a price: it may turn out to be hard or even impossible to
implement.
