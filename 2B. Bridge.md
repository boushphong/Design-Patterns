# Bridge
The Bridge Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. It aims to separate the high-level abstraction from its implementation details, enabling them to evolve independently.

```java
// Workshop abstraction
interface Workshop {
    void work();
}

// Implementations of Workshop
class CarWorkshop implements Workshop {
    @Override
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("being serviced at the CarWorkshop.");
    }
}

class TruckWorkshop implements Workshop {
    @Override
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("being serviced at the TruckWorkshop.");
    }
}

// Vehicle abstraction
abstract class Vehicle {
    protected Workshop workshop;

    public Vehicle(Workshop workshop) {
        this.workshop = workshop;
    }

    public abstract void manufacture();
}

// Implementations of Vehicle
class Car extends Vehicle {
    public Car(Workshop workshop) {
        super(workshop);
    }

    @Override
    public void manufacture() {
        System.out.println("Car is being manufactured.");
        workshop.work();
    }
}

class Truck extends Vehicle {
    public Truck(Workshop workshop) {
        super(workshop);
    }

    @Override
    public void manufacture() {
        System.out.println("Truck is being manufactured.");
        workshop.work();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Car and associate it with a CarWorkshop
        Vehicle car = new Car(new CarWorkshop());
        car.manufacture();
        // Out
        // Car is being manufactured.
        // being serviced at the CarWorkshop.
        
        // Create a Truck and associate it with a TruckWorkshop
        Vehicle truck = new Truck(new TruckWorkshop());
        truck.manufacture();
        // Out
        // Truck is being manufactured.
        // being serviced at the TruckWorkshop.
        
        // Create a Truck and associate it with a CarWorkshop
        Vehicle truck2 = new Truck(new CarWorkshop());
        truck2.manufacture();
        // Out
        // Truck is being manufactured
        // being serviced at the CarWorkshop
    }
}
```

We have a `Vehicle` hierarchy that includes different types of vehicles such as `Car` and `Truck`. Additionally, we have an abstraction called `Workshop` that represents different workshops where vehicles can be serviced, such as a `CarWorkshop` and a `TruckWorkshop`.

To apply the Bridge Design Pattern, we'll create a bridge between the `Vehicle` hierarchy and the `Workshop` hierarchy. This bridge will allow us to have different types of vehicles serviced by different workshops, and it will enable us to vary the vehicle types and workshops independently. For example, a `Car` can be serviced at a `TruckWorkshop` (Changing oils, ... essentially very similar service operations).

In this example, we have an abstraction `Vehicle` that is inherited by `Car` and `Truck`. The `Vehicle` class has a reference to the `Workshop` interface, which represents the workshop where the vehicle is serviced. The `Car` and `Truck` classes override the `manufacture` method and call the `work` method on the associated workshop during the manufacturing process.

The `Workshop` interface defines the `work` method, which is implemented by `CarWorkshop` and `TruckWorkshop` classes. Each workshop class provides its own implementation of the `work` method.

Bridge Design Pattern allows the decoupling of the vehicle hierarchy from the workshop hierarchy. The abstraction (`Vehicle`) and the implementation (`Workshop`) can vary independently, allowing us to introduce new vehicle types or workshops without affecting the existing classes. By doing so, you can have different combinations of vehicles and workshops without directly coupling them together.

## Bridge Design Pattern Summary
**Use the Bridge pattern when you want to divide and organize a monolithic class that has several variants of some functionality (for example, if the class can work with various database servers).**
-  In our example, the monolithic class can be seen as the Vehicle hierarchy, which includes different types of vehicles such as `Car`, `Truck`, and potentially `Motorcycle` in the future. Each vehicle type has its own specific functionality and behavior. For example, a `Car` may have features specific to cars, while a `Truck` may have features specific to trucks. 
-  Instead of implementing all the functionality directly within the Vehicle hierarchy, the Bridge pattern allows us to divide and organize the functionality by introducing separate hierarchies (`Workshop` hierarchy). By separating the `Vehicle` hierarchy from the `Workshop` hierarchy, we can handle the different variants of functionality independently. In our example, the `Workshop` hierarchy represents the different workshops where the vehicles are serviced. Each workshop variant, such as `CarWorkshop` and `TruckWorkshop`, can provide its own specific functionality related to servicing the respective vehicle types.
  - This bridge facilitates the decoupling of the vehicle types from the workshop types, allowing them to vary independently. This enables us to handle various combinations of vehicles and workshops without the need for creating separate classes for each combination. Instead, we can bridge the gap between the vehicle and workshop hierarchies, associating a specific workshop implementation with a specific vehicle at runtime.

**Use the pattern when you need to extend a class in several orthogonal (independent) dimensions.**
- By separating these orthogonal dimensions into separate hierarchies (`Vehicle` and `Workshop`), the Bridge pattern allows you to independently extend and combine different variations. You can introduce new vehicle types or workshop types without affecting the other hierarchy. This enables you to extend the class in multiple dimensions without the need to create an explosion of subclasses for every possible combination.
  - The `Vehicle` hierarchy represents the abstraction hierarchy, which includes different types of vehicles such as `Car` and `Truck`. This hierarchy allows you to extend the class in terms of different vehicle types. Each vehicle type can have its own unique behavior, properties, and methods, representing one orthogonal dimension of extension.
  - The `Workshop` hierarchy represents the implementation hierarchy, which includes different workshop types such as `CarWorkshop` and `TruckWorkshop`. This hierarchy allows you to extend the class in terms of different workshop types. Each workshop type can provide its own specific implementation for servicing the vehicles, representing another orthogonal dimension of extension.
  - Say you want to introduce a new type of vehicle, such as a `Motorcycle`, you can simply create a new class that implements the `Vehicle` interface, without affecting the existing workshop implementations. Similarly, if you want to add a new workshop type, such as a `MotorcycleWorkshop`, you can create a new class that implements the `Workshop` interface, without modifying the existing vehicle implementations.

**Use the Bridge if you need to be able to switch implementations at runtime.**
- In our example, the Bridge pattern allows you to switch the implementation of workshops at runtime while maintaining the connection with the appropriate vehicles.
  - Suppose we have two vehicle types: `Car` and `Truck`, and two workshop types: `CarWorkshop` and `TruckWorkshop`. Initially, a `Car` object is associated with a `CarWorkshop` object, and a `Truck` object is associated with a `TruckWorkshop` object. However, at runtime, if you want to switch the implementation of the workshop for a particular vehicle, the Bridge pattern enables you to do so without modifying the vehicle or creating new subclasses.-
  - ```java
    Vehicle car = new Car(new CarWorkshop());
    car.manufacture();  // being manufactured at CarWorkshop

    // Switch the implementation to a different workshop
    car.setWorkshop(new TruckWorkshop());
    car.manufacture();  // being manufactured at a TruckWorkshop
    ```

  - Next, we switch the implementation of the workshop for the `car` object by calling the `setWorkshop()` method and providing a `TruckWorkshop` object. Now, when we call the `manufacture()` method again, it indicates that the car is being manufactured at the truck workshop instead.

This demonstrates the flexibility of the Bridge pattern in allowing you to switch implementations at runtime. You can dynamically associate different workshops with the same vehicle objects without requiring changes to the vehicle classes themselves. It provides the ability to adapt and switch between different implementations based on the runtime requirements or configuration.

By decoupling the abstraction (vehicle) from its implementation (workshop) through a bridge, the pattern enables you to achieve runtime flexibility and modularity. It allows you to easily switch, mix, or match different implementations without impacting the core abstraction or client code, resulting in a more maintainable and adaptable system.

**NOTE:** When two dimensions are orthogonal, it means that changes or variations in one dimension do not affect or depend on changes in the other dimension.
