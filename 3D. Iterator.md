# Iterator
The Iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying structure. It decouples the traversal logic from the aggregate, allowing the traversal to vary independently.

        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            Vehicle vehicle = iterator.next();
            System.out.println("Brand: " + vehicle.getBrand() + ", Model: " + vehicle.getModel());
        }
        // Brand: Toyota, Model: Corolla
        // Brand: Ford, Model: F-150

```

In this example, the `Vehicle` interface defines the contract for a vehicle, specifying the `getBrand()` and `getModel()` methods. The `Car` and `Truck` classes implement the `Vehicle` interface and provide their own implementations of these methods.

The `VehicleList` class (An Aggregate Class) represents the collection of vehicles. It internally uses a `List<Vehicle>` to store the vehicles. The `VehicleList` class now implements the `Iterable<Vehicle>` interface, which enables it to be used in enhanced for loops and with iterators. The `iterator()` method returns an iterator over the vehicles in the list.

In the `Main` class, we create a `VehicleList` object and add some `Car` and `Truck` instances to it. We can then iterate over the vehicles using `getAllVehicles` and `getFilteredVehicles` methods or an `Iterator<Vehicle>` class with a while loop, and for each vehicle, we can access its brand and model using the `getBrand()` and `getModel()` methods defined in the `Vehicle` interface.

Using the interface-based approach allows us to define common behavior and properties for different types of vehicles while keeping the flexibility to add new vehicle types in the future.

## Iterator Design Pattern Summary
**Use the Iterator pattern when your collection has a complex data structure under the hood, but you want to hide its complexity from clients (either for convenience or security reasons).**

- The `VehicleList` class represents a collection of vehicles, and its underlying data structure may be complex. However, clients interacting with the `VehicleList` don't need to be aware of this complexity. Instead, they can simply use the `Iterator` provided by the `VehicleList` to access and traverse the elements of the collection.
  - By using the Iterator pattern, the complexity of the underlying data structure is encapsulated within the `VehicleList` class. Clients don't need to understand or directly manipulate the internal representation of the collection. They rely on the `Iterator` interface, which provides a uniform and convenient way to iterate over the elements regardless of the underlying implementation.
  - This abstraction offers convenience to clients because they can easily iterate over the collection using a standard set of methods provided by the `Iterator` interface, such as `hasNext()` and `next()`. They don't need to worry about managing indices or dealing with specific collection implementations.
  - Moreover, the Iterator pattern can also provide security benefits. It allows you to control the access and visibility of elements within the collection. The `VehicleList` can decide which elements to expose through its iterator, allowing clients to iterate over a filtered or restricted set of elements based on certain criteria. This ensures that clients only access the elements they are allowed to without exposing the entire internal structure of the collection.
    - In the `VehicleList`, the `getFilteredVehicles(Predicate<Vehicle> condition)` method is implemented to restrict the iteration to only `Car` objects, however this is an alternative approach to the traditional Iterator pattern implementation. If you really want a more fine-grained control approach over the `Iterator<Vehicle>` interface, you could derive an Iterator Class.

**Iterator Class:**
```java
class RestrictedVehicleIterator implements Iterator<Vehicle> {
    private List<Vehicle> vehicles;
    private int currentPosition;

    public RestrictedVehicleIterator(List<Vehicle> vehicles) {
        this.vehicles = vehicles;
        this.currentPosition = 0;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        while (currentPosition < vehicles.size()) {
            Vehicle vehicle = vehicles.get(currentPosition);
            if (vehicle instanceof Truck) {
                return true;
            }
            currentPosition++;
        }
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public Vehicle next() {
        Vehicle vehicle = vehicles.get(currentPosition);
        currentPosition++;
        return vehicle;
    }
}
```
To use the `RestrictedVehicleIterator`, you can modify the `createIterator` method in the `VehicleList` class as follows:
```java
@Override
public Iterator<Vehicle> createTruckIterator() {
    return new RestrictedVehicleIterator(vehicles);
}
```
With this modification, the `createIterator` method returns an instance of the `RestrictedVehicleIterator`, which iterates over Truck objects only.
```java
// Main class
Iterator<Vehicle> iterator = vehicleList.createTruckIterator();
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    Vehicle vehicle = iterator.next();
    System.out.println("Brand: " + vehicle.getBrand() + ", Model: " + vehicle.getModel());
} 
// Output: Brand: Ford, Model: F-150
```

**Use the pattern to reduce duplication of the traversal code across your app.**

**Use the Iterator when you want your code to be able to traverse different data structures or when types of these structures are unknown beforehand.**

- The pattern provides a couple of generic interfaces for both collections (`List<Vehicle>`) and iterators (default JAVA's `Iterator<Vehicle>` and the modified `RestrictedVehicleIterator` that overrides the default Iterator method `next()` and `hasNext`) . Given that your code now uses these interfaces, itâ€™ll still work if you pass it various kinds of collections and iterators that implement these interfaces.

**NOTE:**
In Java, the `Iterator` interface and the `Iterator` implementation classes (`ArrayListIterator`, `LinkedListIterator`, etc.) are part of the Java Collections Framework and are provided by default. You don't need to re-implement them when using the Iterator design pattern.

The Iterator design pattern is more about the usage and structure of the iterator rather than the implementation of the iterator itself. It provides a standard way to access and traverse elements in a collection without exposing its underlying representation. The design pattern defines the roles and responsibilities of the Iterator, Aggregate, and ConcreteIterator classes.
