# Strategy
The Strategy pattern allows you to define a family of interchangeable algorithms and encapsulate each one into a separate class. The pattern enables the algorithms to be selected at runtime based on the context or client's requirements.

```java
// Strategy Interface
interface AccelerationStrategy {
    void accelerate();
}

// Concrete Strategy
class NormalAccelerationStrategy implements AccelerationStrategy {
    @Override
    public void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is accelerating at a normal pace.");
    }
}

// Concrete Strategy
class SportsAccelerationStrategy implements AccelerationStrategy {
    @Override
    public void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is accelerating aggressively!");
    }
}

// Concrete Strategy
class EconomicAccelerationStrategy implements AccelerationStrategy {
    @Override
    public void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is accelerating slowly and conserving fuel.");
    }
}

// Context
class Vehicle {
    private AccelerationStrategy accelerationStrategy;

    public void setAccelerationStrategy(AccelerationStrategy accelerationStrategy) {
        this.accelerationStrategy = accelerationStrategy;
    }

    public void accelerate() {
        accelerationStrategy.accelerate();
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a vehicle
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();

        // Set normal acceleration strategy
        vehicle.setAccelerationStrategy(new NormalAccelerationStrategy());
        vehicle.accelerate(); // Output: Vehicle is accelerating at a normal pace.

        // Set sports car acceleration strategy
        vehicle.setAccelerationStrategy(new SportsAccelerationStrategy());
        vehicle.accelerate(); // Output: Vehicle is accelerating aggressively!

        // Set economic acceleration strategy
        vehicle.setAccelerationStrategy(new EconomicAccelerationStrategy());
        vehicle.accelerate(); // Output: Vehicle is accelerating slowly and conserving fuel.
    }
}
```

In this example, The `Vehicle` class represents a vehicle and has a `accelerationStrategy` field of type `AccelerationStrategy`. This field holds the currently selected strategy for acceleration. The `Vehicle` class also has a `setAccelerationStrategy()` method that allows setting a new acceleration strategy at runtime.

The `AccelerationStrategy` interface defines the contract for all concrete acceleration strategies. It has a single method called `accelerate()`, which encapsulates the algorithm for accelerating the vehicle. There are three concrete implementations of `AccelerationStrategy`, which are `NormalAccelerationStrategy`, `SportsAccelerationStrategy`, `EconomicAccelerationStrategy`.

The `Main` class demonstrates the usage of the Strategy pattern. It creates an instance of the `Vehicle` class and sets different acceleration strategies. It then calls the `accelerate()` method, which delegates the behavior to the currently set acceleration strategy.

By using the Strategy pattern, the `Vehicle` class can easily switch between different acceleration strategies without tightly coupling to any specific strategy implementation. This allows for greater flexibility and extensibility, as new strategies can be added without modifying the `Vehicle` class itself.

# Strategy Design Pattern Summary
**Use the Strategy when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.**

- In the example provided, the `Vehicle` class encapsulates the core behavior related to acceleration. The different acceleration strategies (`EconomicAccelerationStrategy`, `NormalAccelerationStrategy` and `SportsAccelerationStrategy`) represent the algorithms for achieving acceleration in specific contexts. By using the Strategy pattern, the Vehicle class can switch between different strategies without affecting its core implementation, promoting a flexible and modular design.

**Use the pattern to isolate the business logic of a class from the implementation details of algorithms that may not be as important in the context of that logic.**

**Use the pattern when your class has a massive conditional operator that switches between different variants of the same algorithm.**
