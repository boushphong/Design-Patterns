# Creational Design Patterns
Creational petterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. Some creational patterns are:
- `Factory Method`
  - Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- `Abstract Factory`
  - Let's you provive families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- `Builder`
  - Let's you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
- `Prototype`
  - Let's you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
- `Singleton`
  - Let's you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
