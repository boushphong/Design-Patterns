# Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Some behavioral patterns are:
- `Chain of Responsibility`
  - Let's you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
- `Command`
  - Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.
- `Interpreter`
  - Let's you define a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.
- `Iterator`
  - Let's you traverse elements of a collection without exposing it's underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc ...)
- `Mediator`
  - Let's you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.
- `Memento`
  - Let's you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.
- `Observer`
  - Let's you define a subscription mechanism ot notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing.
- `State`
  - Let's an object alter it's behavior when it's internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed it's class.
- `Strategy`
  - Let's you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangable.
- `Template Method`
  - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but let's subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing it's structure.
- `Visitor`
  - Let's you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.
