# Facade
The Facade Design Pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, making it easier to use and understand. It acts as a unified interface that encapsulates the functionality of a set of subsystems, providing a higher-level interface that makes it easier for clients to interact with the system.

```java
// Subsystem classes
class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Engine stopped");
    }
}

// Subsystem classes
class FuelInjector {
    public void on() {
        System.out.println("Fuel injector turned on");
    }

    public void off() {
        System.out.println("Fuel injector turned off");
    }
}

// Subsystem classes
class IgnitionSystem {
    public void ignite() {
        System.out.println("Ignition system ignited");
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("Ignition system turned off");
    }
}

// Facade class
class CarFacade {
    private Engine engine;
    private FuelInjector fuelInjector;
    private IgnitionSystem ignitionSystem;

    public CarFacade() {
        this.engine = new Engine();
        this.fuelInjector = new FuelInjector();
        this.ignitionSystem = new IgnitionSystem();
    }

    public void startCar() {
        System.out.println("Starting the car...");
        engine.start();
        fuelInjector.on();
        ignitionSystem.ignite();
        System.out.println("Car started successfully");
    }

    public void stopCar() {
        System.out.println("Stopping the car...");
        engine.stop();
        fuelInjector.off();
        ignitionSystem.turnOff();
        System.out.println("Car stopped");
    }
}

// Client code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CarFacade carFacade = new CarFacade();

        // Start the car using the facade
        carFacade.startCar();

        // Stop the car using the facade
        carFacade.stopCar();
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a complex system composed of multiple subsystems: `Engine`, `FuelInjector`, and `IgnitionSystem`. Each subsystem has its own set of methods and functionality. The `CarFacade` class acts as a facade that provides a simplified interface to the client. It encapsulates the functionality of the subsystems and exposes higher level methods that allow the client to start and stop the car without needing to interact directly with the subsystems.

The `CarFacade` class internally creates (**Composition Association**) instances of the subsystem classes (`Engine`, `FuelInjector`, and `IgnitionSystem`). The `startCar` and `stopCar` methods of the facade orchestrate the interactions with the subsystems in the appropriate order to start and stop the car.

In the `Main` class, we create an instance of the `CarFacade`. We can then use the facade's `startCar` and `stopCar` methods to start and stop the car, respectively. The client doesn't need to know the internal details or complexities of the subsystems; it simply uses the facade to interact with the car system. This promotes loose-coupling and enhances code maintainability by reducing dependencies on the subsystems and providing a clear and concise interface for clients to work with.

# Facade Design Pattern Summary
**Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.**

- Often, subsystems get more complex over time. Even applying design patterns typically leads to creating more classes. A subsystem may become more flexible and easier to reuse in various contexts, but the amount of configuration and boilerplate code it demands from a client grows ever larger. The Facade attempts to fix this problem by providing a shortcut to the most used features of the subsystem which fit most client requirements.
    - The complex subsystem consists of the `Engine`, `FuelInjector`, and `IgnitionSystem` classes. Interacting with these classes directly would require the client to handle various configurations and method calls. However, the `CarFacade` acts as a facade, providing a straightforward interface with just two methods: `startCar` and `stopCar`. The facade encapsulates the interactions with the subsystem, simplifying the client's code and shielding it from the complexities of the subsystem.

**Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.**

- Facade pattern is used to structure the car subsystem into layers. The subsystem consists of the `Engine`, `FuelInjector`, and `IgnitionSystem` classes. And with the `CarFacade` class provides a simplified interface to the subsystem's layers. It encapsulates the interactions with the underlying layers and shields the client from their complexities. The client then can interact with the car system using the `CarFacade` without needing to know the details of each individual class or layer.
    1. Presentation Layer: The `CarFacade` class serves as the entry point for the client. It provides methods like `startCar` and `stopCar` that the client can use to interact with the car subsystem.
    2. Business Logic Layer: The business logic of starting and stopping the car is distributed across the subsystem's classes (`Engine`, `FuelInjector`, and `IgnitionSystem`). The `CarFacade` coordinates the interactions between these classes to ensure the correct sequence of actions.
    3. Data Access Layer: In this example, there is no explicit data access layer. However, if the subsystem involved data persistence or retrieval, the facade could incorporate the necessary components to handle those operations, providing a simplified interface for the client to interact with the data layer.
