# Interpreter
The Interpreter pattern is a behavioral design pattern that is used to define a language or grammar for a problem domain and provides a way to evaluate or interpret sentences in that language. It allows you to build an interpreter that can parse sentences in the defined language and perform actions based on the parsed expressions.

In this example, say we want to define a simple language for specifying actions or commands related to vehicles. We might have commands like "drive", "stop", "refuel", etc. Each command can be associated with a specific action that should be performed on a vehicle.

Certainly! The Interpreter pattern is a behavioral design pattern that is used to define a language or grammar for a problem domain and provides a way to evaluate or interpret sentences in that language. It allows you to build an interpreter that can parse sentences in the defined language and perform actions based on the parsed expressions.

In the context of the `Vehicle` example, let's say we want to define a simple language for specifying actions or commands related to vehicles. For example, we might have commands like "drive", "stop", "refuel", etc. Each command can be associated with a specific action that should be performed on a vehicle.

We'll need the following components to implement the interpreter pattern:
1. Abstract Expression (`Expression`): This interface represents the abstract syntax tree node of the language. It declares an `interpret` method that takes a `Vehicle` object and performs the specific action associated with the expression.

2. Terminal Expression (`TerminalExpression`): This class implements the `Expression` interface and represents the terminal expressions or leaf nodes of the abstract syntax tree. In our example, we can have classes like `DriveExpression`, `StopExpression`, `RefuelExpression`, etc., which implement the `interpret` method accordingly.

3. Non-terminal Expression (`NonTerminalExpression`): This class (`CompositeExpression`) also implements the `Expression` interface and represents the non-terminal expressions or composite nodes of the abstract syntax tree. It can contain multiple child expressions and implement the `interpret` method by performing some composite operation.

We define the `Expression` interface that declares the `interpret` method. Each concrete expression class (`DriveExpression`, `StopExpression`, `RefuelExpression`) implements the `interpret` method to perform the specific action on the `Vehicle` object. The `CommandParser` class acts as the interpreter and contains a mapping of commands to corresponding expressions. It parses the input command and invokes the `interpret` method on the corresponding expression. If the command is not recognized, it displays an error message.

## Interpreter Design Pattern Summary

**Use the Interpreter pattern when you need to interpret and evaluate expressions or grammars in your application (SQL,Regex ...)**

- It's best to design apply this pattern when you have a language or a domain-specific problem that can be represented as an Abstract Syntax Tree ([AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree))
- Or when you want to create a domain-specific language (DSL) or provide a way to specify complex rules or behaviors using a simple syntax.

**Use the Interpreter pattern when you want to decouple the grammar and rules from the implementation details of the expressions.**

**Use the Interpreter pattern when the grammar is simple and stable, but you expect frequent variations or extensions in the expressions.**

## NOTE
The usage of the Interpreter pattern can be extremely rare. However, it is commonly seen used in areas such as query languages, regular expressions, mathematical expressions, template engines, and rule-based systems. It allows you to define a language, grammar, or set of rules and provide a way to interpret and process them efficiently.
