# Composite
The Composite Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

interface Vehicle {
    void accelerate();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Car is accelerating.");
    }
}

class Truck implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Truck is accelerating.");
    }
}

class VehicleTestingFacility implements Vehicle {
    private List<Vehicle> vehicles = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        vehicles.add(vehicle);
    }

    public void removeVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        vehicles.remove(vehicle);
    }

    @Override
    public void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle Testing Facility is conducting acceleration tests.");

        for (Vehicle vehicle : vehicles) {
            vehicle.accelerate();
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car1 = new Car();
        Vehicle car2 = new Car();
        Vehicle truck1 = new Truck();
        Vehicle truck2 = new Truck();

        VehicleTestingFacility carTestingFacility = new VehicleTestingFacility();
        carTestingFacility.addVehicle(car1);
        carTestingFacility.addVehicle(car2);
        carTestingFacility.accelerate();
        /* OUTPUT
        Vehicle Testing Facility is conducting acceleration tests.
        Car is accelerating.
        Car is accelerating.
        */

        VehicleTestingFacility truckTestingFacility = new VehicleTestingFacility();
        truckTestingFacility.addVehicle(truck1);
        truckTestingFacility.addVehicle(truck2);
        truckTestingFacility.accelerate();
        /* OUTPUT
        Vehicle Testing Facility is conducting acceleration tests.
        Truck is accelerating.
        Truck is accelerating.
        */

        VehicleTestingFacility generalTestingFacility = new VehicleTestingFacility();
        generalTestingFacility.addVehicle(carTestingFacility);
        generalTestingFacility.addVehicle(truckTestingFacility);
        Vehicle ferrari = new Car();
        generalTestingFacility.addVehicle(ferrari);
        generalTestingFacility.accelerate();
        /* OUTPUT
        Vehicle Testing Facility is conducting acceleration tests.
        Vehicle Testing Facility is conducting acceleration tests.
        Car is accelerating.
        Car is accelerating.
        Vehicle Testing Facility is conducting acceleration tests.
        Truck is accelerating.
        Truck is accelerating.
        Car is accelerating.
        */
    }
}
```

In this example, we have the `Vehicle` interface with the `accelerate()` method. The `Car` and `Truck` classes implement the `Vehicle` interface and provide their specific implementations of the `accelerate()` method. The `VehicleTestingFacility` class acts as the composite class. It maintains a list of `Vehicle` objects using the `vehicles` list.

The `accelerate()` method in the `VehicleTestingFacility` class overrides the same method in the `Vehicle` interface. It conducts acceleration tests by iterating over the list of vehicles and invoking the `accelerate()` method on each vehicle.

In the `Main` class, we create instances of `Car` and `Truck`, as well as instances of `VehicleTestingFacility` to represent specific testing facilities for cars and trucks. We add the individual cars and trucks to their respective testing facilities using the `addVehicle()` method. When we call the `accelerate()` method on each testing facility, it conducts the acceleration tests for the vehicles contained within.

The `Main` class demonstrates the use of the composite structure. The `carTestingFacility`, `truckTestingFacility` and the individual `ferrari` objects are the **Leaf components** that are created and added to the `generalTestingFacility` Composite. The `generalTestingFacility` object is itself a Composite that contains both the Leaf components and other Composite objects.

When `generalTestingFacility.accelerate()` is called, it calls `accelerate()` on each of its components, and since both `carTestingFacility` and `truckTestingFacility` are Composites themselves, their `accelerate()` methods are called, which in turn calls `accelerate()` on all the `Car` and `Truck` objects they contain, and finally the `accelerate()` methods of last object `ferrari` will be called.

Therefore, the Composite design pattern provides a way to treat both composite and individual objects uniformly, making it possible to create a nested recursive hierarchy of objects. This pattern is useful when a client needs to work with both individual objects and groups of objects in a similar way.

## Structural Design Pattern Summary
**Use the Composite pattern when you have to implement a tree-like object structure.**

- The Composite pattern provides you with two basic element types that share a common interface (`Vehicle`): simple leaves and complex containers' leaves (simple leaf: `ferrari`, complex: `truckTestingFacility`, `carTestingFacility`). A container can be composed of both leaves and other containers. This lets you construct a nested recursive object structure that resembles a tree.

**Use the pattern when you want the client code to treat both simple and complex elements uniformly.**

- All elements defined by the Composite pattern share a common interface. Using this interface, the client doesnâ€™t have to worry about the concrete class of the objects it works with.
