# State
The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It encapsulates different behaviors into separate classes and delegates the behavior to the current state object. The pattern promotes clean code by avoiding large conditional statements that check the object's state.

```java
// Context
class Vehicle {
    private VehicleState state;

    public Vehicle() {
        // Set the initial state to "stopped"
        state = new StoppedState();
    }

    public void setState(VehicleState state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public void start() {
        state.start(this);
    }

    public void accelerate() {
        state.accelerate(this);
    }

    public void brake() {
        state.brake(this);
    }

    public void stop() {
        state.stop(this);
    }
}

// State Interface
interface VehicleState {
    void start(Vehicle vehicle);
    void accelerate(Vehicle vehicle);
    void brake(Vehicle vehicle);
    void stop(Vehicle vehicle);
}

// Concrete State
class StoppedState implements VehicleState {
    @Override
    public void start(Vehicle vehicle) {
        System.out.println("Starting the vehicle.");
        // Transition to the "moving" state
        vehicle.setState(new MovingState());
    }

    @Override
    public void accelerate(Vehicle vehicle) {
        System.out.println("Cannot accelerate. The vehicle is stopped.");
    }

    @Override
    public void brake(Vehicle vehicle) {
        System.out.println("Cannot brake. The vehicle is already stopped.");
    }

    @Override
    public void stop(Vehicle vehicle) {
        System.out.println("The vehicle is already stopped.");
    }
}

// Concrete State
class MovingState implements VehicleState {
    @Override
    public void start(Vehicle vehicle) {
        System.out.println("The vehicle is already moving.");
    }

    @Override
    public void accelerate(Vehicle vehicle) {
        System.out.println("Accelerating the vehicle.");
        // Continue in the "moving" state
    }

    @Override
    public void brake(Vehicle vehicle) {
        System.out.println("Braking the vehicle.");
        // Transition to the "stopped" state
        vehicle.setState(new StoppedState());
    }

    @Override
    public void stop(Vehicle vehicle) {
        System.out.println("Cannot stop. The vehicle is moving.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a vehicle
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();

        // Start the vehicle
        vehicle.stop(); // Output: The vehicle is already stopped.
        vehicle.start(); // Output: Starting the vehicle.

        // Accelerate the vehicle
        vehicle.accelerate(); // Output: Accelerating the vehicle.

        // Brake the vehicle
        vehicle.brake(); // Output: Braking the vehicle.

        // Stop the vehicle
        vehicle.stop(); // Output: The vehicle is already stopped.
    }
}
```

The `Vehicle` class is the context class that represents a vehicle. It has a reference to the current state object and delegates the behavior to that state object. The `VehicleState` interface defines the methods that represent the different behaviors of a vehicle in each state. In this example, we have four methods: `start`, `accelerate`, `brake`, and `stop`.

The `StoppedState` class is a concrete implementation of the `VehicleState` interface. It represents the state of a vehicle when it is stopped. In this state, the vehicle can be started, but it cannot accelerate, brake, or stop again since it is already stopped. When the `start` method is called in this state, it prints a message indicating that the vehicle is starting and transitions the vehicle's state to `MovingState`.

The `MovingState` class is another concrete implementation of the `VehicleState` interface. It represents the state of a vehicle when it is moving. In this state, the vehicle can accelerate, brake, or stop. When the `accelerate` method is called in this state, it prints a message indicating that the vehicle is accelerating. When the `brake` method is called, it prints a message indicating that the vehicle is braking and transitions the vehicle's state back to `StoppedState`.

In the `Main` class, we create an instance of the `Vehicle` class. We then call various methods on the vehicle object to demonstrate the state transitions and behavior delegation. 

The State pattern allows the vehicle object to exhibit different behaviors based on its internal state, providing a clean and modular approach to handle state-specific behavior.

# State Design Pattern Summary
**Use the State pattern when you have an object that behaves differently depending on its current state, the number of states is enormous, and the state-specific code changes frequently.**

- The pattern suggests that you extract all state-specific code into a set of distinct classes (into `MovingState` and `StoppedState`). As a result, you can add new states or change existing ones independently of each other, reducing the maintenance cost.

**Use the pattern when you have a class polluted with massive conditionals that alter how the class behaves according to the current values of the classâ€™s fields.**

**Use State when you have a lot of duplicate code across similar states and transitions of a condition-based state machine.**
