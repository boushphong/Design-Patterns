# Builder

The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

The Builder pattern is useful when you need to create objects that have many configurable properties, and you want to simplify the object creation process by providing a clear and readable API.

```java
class Car {
    private String brand;
    private String model;
    private int year;
    private String color;
    private int numberOfSeats;

    public Car(String brand, String model, int year, String color, int numberOfSeats) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
        this.color = color;
        this.numberOfSeats = numberOfSeats;
    }

    public String getBrand() {
        return brand;
    }

    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }

    public int getYear() {
        return year;
    }

    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    public int getNumberOfSeats() {
        return numberOfSeats;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Car{" +
                "brand='" + brand + '\'' +
                ", model='" + model + '\'' +
                ", year=" + year +
                ", color='" + color + '\'' +
                ", numberOfSeats=" + numberOfSeats +
                '}';
    }
}

class CarBuilder {
    private String brand;
    private String model;
    private int year;
    private String color;
    private int numberOfSeats;

    public CarBuilder setBrand(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
        return this;
    }

    public CarBuilder setModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
        return this;
    }

    public CarBuilder setYear(int year) {
        this.year = year;
        return this;
    }

    public CarBuilder setColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
        return this;
    }

    public CarBuilder setNumberOfSeats(int numberOfSeats) {
        this.numberOfSeats = numberOfSeats;
        return this;
    }

    public Car build() {
        return new Car(brand, model, year, color, numberOfSeats);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new CarBuilder()
                .setBrand("Toyota")
                .setModel("Camry")
                .setYear(2022)
                .setColor("Red")
                .setNumberOfSeats(5)
                .build();

        System.out.println(car);
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a `Car` class representing a car with various properties such as brand, model, year, color, and number of seats.

We also have a `CarBuilder` class that provides a fluent API for constructing the `Car` object. The `CarBuilder` class allows you to set individual properties of the car using setter methods, and it returns the builder object itself after each method call, allowing method chaining.

The `CarBuilder` class also has a `build()` method that creates and returns the final `Car` object with the configured properties.

In the `main` method, we use the `CarBuilder` to construct a `Car` object by setting its properties using the fluent API. Finally, we print the resulting `Car` object.

The Builder Design Pattern allows you to construct complex objects step by step, providing a flexible and readable way to configure object properties.
