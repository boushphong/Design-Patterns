# Builder

The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

The Builder pattern is useful when you need to create objects that have many configurable properties, and you want to simplify the object creation process by providing a clear and readable API.

1. The `Builder` interface:
- It defines the common methods that builders must implement: `setBrand`, `setModel`, `setYear`, `setColor`, `setNumberOfSeats`, and `reset`.
- The `reset` method allows resetting the builder's internal state, preparing it for a fresh construction process.

2. The `Car` class:
- It represents the product object that we want to construct using the builder.
- It has various properties such as brand, model, year, color, and numberOfSeats.
- The class has a constructor that takes these properties as parameters and sets them.

3. The `CarBuilder` class:    
- It implements the `Builder` interface, providing the implementations for all the methods.
- It also has private fields to hold the properties of the car being constructed: `brand`, `model`, `year`, `color`, and `numberOfSeats`.
- The `setXXX` methods allow setting individual properties of the car.
- The `reset` method resets the builder's state by setting all the properties to their initial or default values.
- The `getProduct` method creates and returns a new `Car` object with the configured properties.

4. The `Director` class:    
- It is responsible for the construction process and uses a builder to create the car object.
- The `constructSportsCar` method takes a `Builder` object as a parameter and constructs a sports car.
- Before setting the properties of the car, it calls the `reset` method on the builder to ensure a clean state.

The `CarBuilder` class separates the construction of the `Car` object from its representation, allowing step-by-step configuration of its properties. The `Director` class coordinates the construction process by providing a method to construct a sports car. The `Builder` interface provides a consistent interface for different builders to construct objects. This pattern promotes a clear and readable API for building complex objects.

The Builder Design Pattern allows you to construct complex objects step by step, providing a flexible and readable way to configure object properties.

## Builder Design Pattern Summary:
- Use the Builder pattern when you want your code to be able to create different `Object` representations. For instance instead of having just a `CarBuilder` class, there can be classes like `ManualBuilder`, `SedanBuilder`, `SUVBuilder` ... that all implements the `Builder` interface but create different kinds of `Object`.
- A builder doesnâ€™t expose the unfinished `Object` while running construction steps. This prevents the client code from fetching an incomplete result.
- Let's you construct unrelated products that don't follow a common interface.
